NAME
    Module::Package - Postmodern Perl Module Packaging

SYNOPSIS
    In you "Makefile.PL":

        use inc::Package;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a dropin replacement for Module::Install. It does
    everything Module::Install does, but just a bit better.

    Now that you've heard the sell, here's the simple truth. Module::Package
    is an exteremely tiny wrapper around Module::Install. All it does is
    load Module::Install and call the "pkg" directive. This in turn, loads
    Module::Install::Package.

    But that's where the magic begins. Module::Install::Package attempts to
    fix most of the problems of Module::Install, in one go.

MORE DOCUMENTATION
    Coming soon...

FUN FACT
    This module uses itself to package itself. Take a look!

STATUS
    This is a early, "proving concepts", release. Keep out.
